# Data-Analysis-to-predict-the-CO2-Emission-
We have a dataset which contains various features of the car based on which we predict the Carbon dioxide emission.

This dataset contains fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.
Data Source: 'https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64'

Here is a description of some of the features that are in the dataset.

MODELYEAR e.g. 2014
MAKE e.g. Acura
MODEL e.g. ILX
VEHICLE CLASS e.g. SUV
ENGINE SIZE e.g. 4.7
CYLINDERS e.g 6
TRANSMISSION e.g. A6
FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km) e.g. 9.9
FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km) e.g. 8.9
FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km) e.g. 9.2
CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) e.g. 182 --> low --> 0

I will include a jupyter notebook file for ease.
