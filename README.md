# Data-Analysis-to-predict-the-CO2-Emission-
We have a dataset which contains various features of the car based on which we predict the Carbon dioxide emission.<br>
<br>
This dataset contains fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.<br>
Data Source: 'https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64'<br>
<br>
Here is a description of some of the features that are in the dataset.<br>
<br>
MODELYEAR e.g. 2014<br>
MAKE e.g. Acura<br>
MODEL e.g. ILX<br>
VEHICLE CLASS e.g. SUV<br>
ENGINE SIZE e.g. 4.7<br>
CYLINDERS e.g 6<br>
TRANSMISSION e.g. A6<br>
FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km) e.g. 9.9<br>
FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km) e.g. 8.9<br>
FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km) e.g. 9.2<br>
CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) e.g. 182 --> low --> 0<br>
<br>
I will include a jupyter notebook file for those who want to use it directly. 
HTML file of the same project is also available for people who do not have access to the jupyter notebooks.
