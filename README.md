# Data-Analysis-to-predict-the-CO2-Emission-
We have a dataset which contains various features of the car based on which we predict the Carbon dioxide emission.<br>
<br>
This dataset contains fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.<br>
Data Source: 'https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64'<br>
<br>
Here is a description of some of the features that are in the dataset.<br>
<br>
MODELYEAR e.g. 2014<br>
MAKE e.g. Acura<br>
MODEL e.g. ILX<br>
VEHICLE CLASS e.g. SUV<br>
ENGINE SIZE e.g. 4.7<br>
CYLINDERS e.g 6<br>
TRANSMISSION e.g. A6<br>
FUEL CONSUMPTION in CITY(L/100 km) e.g. 9.9<br>
FUEL CONSUMPTION in HWY (L/100 km) e.g. 8.9<br>
FUEL CONSUMPTION COMB (L/100 km) e.g. 9.2<br>
CO2 EMISSIONS (g/km) e.g. 182 --> low --> 0<br>
<br>
I will include a jupyter notebook file for those who want to use it directly. 
I have also included the html file of the same project so that people who are not having jupyter can view it.
